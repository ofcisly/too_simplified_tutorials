The one with the Terminal &amp; other setup</h1>
<p>Remember the scenes in Hollywood movies where hackers sit in front of
a computer and type something definitely not in English in a black
window like this?</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’re going to learn to set up the terminal, which
is a black screen you can type stuff in (but you can set it to any other
color you want). You’ll see that it won’t be anything like in those
hacker movies, (and if you read more online you’ll see that those
hacking scences ain’t anything like the real world hacks…) but it will
still be very cool I promise.</p>
<p>Before we get into the terminal part, we’ll first go through some
setup and get you download a few tools to your computer. This tutorial
and the rest will be done with the assumption that you’re using a Mac.
<strong><em>If you’ve not updated your mac to the latest OS, please do
so. Remember to backup your data, always backup your data
first!</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="spotlight">Spotlight</h2>
<p>Your Mac comes not with fries but a powerful tool called Spotlight.
It’s that magnifier icon on the upper right:</p>
<figure>
<img
src="data/001-use-spotlight-mac-4586951-4db79788ac374ef388688ceb701264c4.png"
alt="spotlight" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">spotlight</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Spotlight can <strong>index</strong> your whole computer. You’ll come
across the term <em>index</em> more often when you learn about search.
Think of it as a way to mark every stuff in your computer so it’s easier
to find later.</p>
<p>Gone are the days you have to click on Launchpad and look around for
an app. Now you just have to launch Spotlight/Alfred and type in the
name of the app it’ll find it for you. The only thing you have to do is
to set a shortcut for launching Alfred/Spotlight.</p>
<p>To find out/set the shortcut for launching spotlight, you go to
System Preferences –&gt; Keyboard –&gt; Shortcuts –&gt; Choose Spotlight
on the left column.</p>
<figure>
<img src="data/spotlight_shortcut.png" alt="spotlight" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">spotlight</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You only need to check <code>Show Spotlight search</code>, then click
on the box on the right, enter your shortcut and Enter. I often use
<code>command + space</code> (command symbol = ugly 4-leaf clover), so
just like in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>Now just <code>command + space</code>, Spotlight should show up for
you. Then type on the name of whatever you want to find, it shall shown
you a bunch of results to choose from. For example here I’m looking for
VS Code:</p>
<figure>

<h2 id="iterm2">iTerm2</h2>
<p>Mac comes with a terminal app, but it’s not good enough. Please use
iTerm2, download from <a
href="https://iterm2.com/downloads.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It should download a .zip file, just click on it to extract the app.
Drag &amp; drop it to the <code>Applications</code> folder then you’re
good to go.</p>
<figure>
<img src="data/iterm2.png" alt="iterm2" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">iterm2</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="vscode">VSCode</h2>
<p>VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is a code editor, i.e. a text-editor but
for code. Think of it like Microsoft Word but has all sort of fancy
functions to support writing code.</p>
<p>Similar to iTerm2, just download it, click on the zip file to
extract, then drag &amp; drop to <code>Applications</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-tools">Command-line tools</h2>
<p>On the way to learn programming, you’ll have to use a lot of
supporting tools. Don’t have to think too much about it, just know that
you’ll need a lot of tools. Don’t need to know what they are, just know
you can install most of them through
<code>Xcode Command-line Tools</code>. To do this, open your iTerm2: -
<code>command + space</code> to launch Spotlight - type in
<code>iTerm2</code> - Use up/down arrows to select <code>iTerm2</code>
and enter</p>
<p>In the iTerm2 window, type in <code>xcode-select --install</code>,
and Enter. You’ll see something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="data/install-Xcode-CLT.png" alt="cmdline" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">cmdline</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just click Install &amp; wait until it looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="data/install-Xcode-CLT-done.png" alt="cmdline_done" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">cmdline_done</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>
<p>In the next tutorial when we learn more about the terminal, we’ll see
that there are a lot of cool programs we can run there. But just like
life, computers and programs are ever changing. To control this, we
often designate a version to a release of a software so we know which is
which. This is very important. For example, you’re writing a program
that depends on another program X. You test and know for sure your code
works fine if X_version=1.0. But you’ll never know if X_version=1.1 will
stay the same or not, so you should specifically mention in your code
that it has to be X_version=1.0.</p>
<p>Anyway, this highlights a need to have some software to manager all
versions of any program. Software like this is called package manager. A
program is a package. A library (just think of it as a bunch of
supporting code) is also a package. And a package manager knows all of
them, past and future, one ring to rule them all.</p>
<p>For mac, the most popular package manager is called Homebrew. To
install it, simply head to <a href="https://brew.sh/">brew.sh</a>, copy
&amp; paste the command there into your iTerm2 window and Enter.</p>
<p>You can find example screenshots of the installation <a
href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-homebrew-on-mac#ftoc-heading-3">on
this website</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll see how to use homebrew to install something later.</p>
<h2 id="oh-my-zsh">Oh-my-zsh</h2>
<p>If you open your iTerm2 window right you, you can see that it’s
kinda…boring. There’s a tool to make it more colorful, but more
importantly, make it much easier to use through crazy tons of built-in
functions. It’s called oh-my-zsh. We’ll talk about zsh later.</p>
<p>To install oh-my-zsh, simply run a command copied from <a
href="https://ohmyz.sh/#install">https://ohmyz.sh/#install</a>.</p>
<p>If it asks, just say Yes. We’ll see how much easier oh-my-zsh does to
your life later.</p>
<h2 id="something-cool">Something cool</h2>
<p>Now you have a Terminal!!! Now, I promised something cool, so let’s
try something cool!</p>
<h3 id="youtube-dl">youtube-dl</h3>
<p>Do you know you can download youtube videos from your computer,
without using any website or sketchy software??? Lemme welcome you to <a
href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>!</p>
<p>Let’s install it with Homebrew, in an iTerm2 window, type in:</p>
<p><code>brew install youtube-dl</code></p>
<p>It should look like this: <img src="data/youtube-dl.png"
alt="youtube-dl" /></p>
<p>Let’s download this song to practice the living room routine. In your
iTerm2 window, enter:</p>
<p><code>youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=zzRr55RGYc4</code></p>
<p>It’ll proceed to download and looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="data/youtube-dl-download.png" alt="youtube-dl-download" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">youtube-dl-download</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Btw, if you’re looking for the best video player for mac, try <a
href="https://iina.io/">IINA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="watching-star-wars">Watching Star Wars</h3>
<p>Yeah, I’m not kidding. You can watch Star Wars from the Terminal!</p>
<p>First install <code>telnet</code>:</p>
<p><code>brew install telnet</code></p>
<p>After telnet is successfully installed, type in:</p>
<p><code>telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code></p>
<p>and Enter! Enjoy. Recommend with some popcorns.</p>
<p><img src="data/starwars.png" alt="starwards" /> <img
src="data/vader.png" alt="vader" /> <img src="data/robots.png"
alt="robots" /></p>
<h3 id="matrix">Matrix</h3>
<p>You’ll learn how to print something on the terminal later. Now think
about it, that scence in the Matrix is simply printing out
letters/digits on the terminal continuously, right? Somebody already
wrote it so we can simply test it out. The source is from <a
href="https://osxdaily.com/2013/08/15/turn-the-terminal-into-a-matrix-style-scrolling-screen-of-binary-or-gibberish/">here</a>.
In your iTerm2 window, copy and paste this then Enter:</p>
<p><code>LC_ALL=C tr -c "[:digit:]" " " &lt; /dev/urandom | dd cbs=$COLUMNS conv=unblock | GREP_COLOR="1;32" grep --color "[^ ]"</code></p>
<p>It shall look like this:</p>

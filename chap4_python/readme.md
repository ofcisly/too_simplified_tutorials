I sat down and tried to write a Python tutorial. I just couldn't. I'm not good enough, I'm sorry I'm not worthy. Okay enough self deprecating.  

You've probably heard of top-down and bottom-up learning approaches. I'm a lifelong bottom-up learner. I find it easier that way. But many people, especially when it comes to programming, are devoted to top-down. I get it, top-down is more hands-on.  

If you need a top-down Python book, I suggest [Learn Python the hard way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888).  

If you need a bottom-up book, I suggest [Dive into Python3](https://diveintopython3.net/index.html).  

And if you have time, I actually suggest to do this: go through the hardway book, do as it says, type out your programs, run them. Then as you find yourself being able to write simple programs already, go through the second book.
